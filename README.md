# FitBit to MongoDB

Load FitBit data into MongoDB.

## Motivation

I wanted to get my FitBit data into a time series database, but the 150 requests/hour rate limit of the Personal Application API slowed me down. By first loading the data into MongoDB, I get a local cache that I can work off, without risking API throttling.
